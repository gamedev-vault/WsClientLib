# WsClientLib
Websocket Client Library

## Motivation

The main motivation behind the library is to create a simple Websocket client library working out-of-the-box on Windows environment. There are other Websocket libraries but they are either bloated due to including server code or Windows environment is neglected and frequently doesn't build right away. 

## Dependencies

The library's aim is to minimize external dependencies. The only external dependency is the TLS library.
